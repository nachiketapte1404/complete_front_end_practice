# Odin Project
This project is part of my learning with the Odin Project.<br/>
I am currently doing the foundation course on the website and they have asked me to create a repository <br/>
This is a great opportunity as I have to make the complete start page of a website acc to specifications<br/>
given by them <br/>
This will help make my skills sharp and upto the mark <br/>
